# Hammed Email Filtering Tool - User Guide
 
## üìò Overview
 
**Hammed** is a custom-built Outlook automation tool that helps manage and automatically respond to unsolicited emails. It works by maintaining a **whitelist of approved domains**, and optionally checking for a **secret word** in the subject line to bypass the filter. Emails not meeting those criteria are automatically moved to a special folder (`Hammed`), marked as read, and optionally replied to with a standard response.

**NOTE:** Hammed will only work on Microsoft Windows Outlook environment.  Sorry Mac users.

## üîß Configuration
 
### Required Files
 
The Hammed tool expects the following files to be present in a user-specific folder:

These include:

- `reply.txt` ‚Äî Standard reply body for auto-responses
- `secret.txt` ‚Äî Optional keyword to allow a message through
- `Hammed.ini` ‚Äî Configuration file for the tool

## üì¨ What Hammed Does
 
### Workflow:
 
1. A new mail arrives in your Inbox.
2. If it's from a **whitelisted domain** or contains the **secret word** in the subject:
   - It is **left alone**
3. If not:
   - It is **moved to the `Hammed` folder**
   - Marked as **read**
   - A reply is optionally sent (or saved to Drafts, depending on config)
   - A full audit log is written to `HamDebugLog.txt`
   - If it **should** be in your whitelist but it is not, see the AddWL macro below
 
### Logging
 
Logs are stored in:
```
D:\Users\<your-username>\AppData\Local\Hammed\HamDebugLog.txt
```
 
If this file cannot be written to, a fallback `HamDebugLog2.txt` is used.
